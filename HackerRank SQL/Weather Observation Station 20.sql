A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(LAT_N, 4) AS MEDIAN_LAT_N
FROM (
    SELECT LAT_N, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS row_num,
           COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_rows
    FROM STATION
) AS ordered_data
WHERE row_num IN (FLOOR((total_rows + 1) / 2), CEIL((total_rows + 1) / 2));
