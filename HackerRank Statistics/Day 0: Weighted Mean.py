# Objective
# In the previous challenge, we calculated a mean. In this challenge, we practice calculating a weighted mean. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

# Task
# Given an array, , of  integers and an array, , representing the respective weights of 's elements, calculate and print the weighted mean of 's elements. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e.,  format).

# Example


# The array of values . Their sum is . The sum of . The weighted mean is . Print  and return.

# Function Description
# Complete the weightedMean function in the editor below.

# weightedMean has the following parameters:
# - int X[N]: an array of values
# - int W[N]: an array of weights

# Prints
# - float: the weighted mean to one decimal place

# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, , the number of elements in arrays  and .
# The second line contains  space-separated integers that descdribe the elements of array .
# The third line contains  space-separated integers that descdribe the elements of array .

# Constraints

# , where  is the  element of array .
# , where  is the  element of array .
# Output Format

# Print the weighted mean on a new line. Your answer should be rounded to a scale of  decimal place (i.e.,  format).

# Sample Input

# STDIN           Function
# -----           --------
# 5               X[] and W[] size n = 5
# 10 40 30 50 20  X = [10, 40, 30, 50, 20]  
# 1 2 3 4 5       W = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Sample Output

# 32.0
# Explanation

# We use the following formula to calculate the weighted mean:

# And then print our result to a scale of  decimal place () on a new line.
